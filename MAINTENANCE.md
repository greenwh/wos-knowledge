# Battle Book — Maintenance Workflow

How to keep the Battle Book up to date without it becoming a second job.

## The two routine tasks

**Adding a new content page** and **updating an existing page** are the only routine tasks. Both should take under 5 minutes once the workflow is muscle memory.

## Workflow 1 — Adding a new page

### Step 1: Ask Claude (chat) to write it

Examples of what to ask:

> "Write a Bear Trap event guide for the Battle Book. Use the event template."

> "Write a strategy page for Flint covering his rework and current priority. Use the hero template."

> "Write a combat reference page on the garrison swap technique. Use the combat reference template."

Claude produces a single Markdown (`.md`) file with verified content following the appropriate template.

### Step 2: Save the file

Save Claude's Markdown output to the correct path in your local clone of the `wos-knowledge` repo. Path conventions:

| Content type | Folder |
|---|---|
| Event guide | `docs/events/[event-slug].md` (or subfolder for multi-page events like SvS) |
| Hero page | `docs/heroes/[class]/[hero-name].md` |
| Combat reference | `docs/combat/[topic].md` |
| Gear strategy | `docs/gear/[topic].md` |
| Troops topic | `docs/troops/[topic].md` |
| Pet guide | `docs/pets/[pet-name].md` |
| Reference data | `docs/reference/[topic].md` |
| Orientation | `docs/orientation/[topic].md` |

If the folder doesn't exist yet (e.g. you're adding the first hero page and `docs/heroes/` doesn't exist), create the folder first.

### Step 3: Add to the sidebar

Open `docs/.vitepress/config.ts` and find the `sidebar` config. Add one entry under the appropriate section.

For an event guide:
```typescript
'/events/': [
  {
    text: 'Events',
    items: [
      { text: 'Event Hub', link: '/events/' },
      { text: 'SvS', collapsed: false, items: [...] },
      { text: 'Bear Trap', link: '/events/bear-trap' },  // ← new line
    ],
  },
],
```

For a new section entirely (e.g. first hero page), add a new sidebar group:
```typescript
'/heroes/': [
  {
    text: 'Heroes',
    items: [
      { text: 'Hero Hub', link: '/heroes/' },
      { text: 'Flint', link: '/heroes/infantry/flint' },
    ],
  },
],
```

And add a top-nav entry:
```typescript
nav: [
  { text: 'Home', link: '/' },
  { text: 'Events', link: '/events/' },
  { text: 'Heroes', link: '/heroes/' },     // ← new line
  { text: 'Troops', link: '/troops/' },
  { text: 'Reference', link: '/reference/glossary' },
],
```

### Step 4: Commit and push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Add Bear Trap event guide"
git push
```

GitHub Actions auto-deploys. Live in 2–3 minutes.

### Step 5: Update the changelog

Add a one-line entry to `docs/reference/changelog.md` under the current month so readers can see what's new.

## Workflow 2 — Updating an existing page

### Step 1: Ask Claude (chat) to update

Examples:

> "The October 22 patch changed the Castle Battle to 5 hours / 2.5 hour win condition. Update the SvS overview accordingly."

> "Mythic Hero Shard scoring changed to 3,500 pts. Update the SvS guide."

> "Add a section on the reforge trick to the SvS overview."

Claude produces the updated `.md` file.

### Step 2: Replace the file

Drop Claude's output into the same path, overwriting the existing file.

### Step 3: Commit and push

```bash
git add .
git commit -m "Update SvS overview — Oct 2025 castle battle patch"
git push
```

### Step 4: Update the `Last verified` date

Every content page ends with a date line:
```markdown
*Last verified: [Date] · Sources: [...]*
```

Update the date when the content changes. This is how readers (and you, six months from now) tell stale pages from fresh ones.

## Workflow 3 — Quarterly verification pass (every 3 months)

This is the discipline that keeps the site from rotting.

Once a quarter, ask Claude:

> "Quarterly verification pass on the Battle Book. Check the SvS overview, prep checklist, and troop ratios pages against current sources. Flag any values that have changed."

Claude does a fresh research pass and surfaces any discrepancies. You decide what to update.

A reasonable rhythm: do this in the same week you do your tax estimates, or pick a recurring date (the 15th of every third month). Set a calendar reminder.

## MANIFEST.md — Source of Truth

Every Claude Code deployment session must regenerate MANIFEST.md before committing:

```bash
bash scripts/generate-manifest.sh
git add MANIFEST.md
```

This file is what chat Claude reads at the start of any Battle Book session to know what's actually deployed. If MANIFEST.md is stale, chat Claude will plan against the wrong state and we'll end up with the kind of drift we saw in May 2026 (changelog claimed pages existed that didn't).

**For chat Claude (you reading this):** at the start of any Battle Book work, fetch:
https://raw.githubusercontent.com/greenwh/wos-knowledge/main/MANIFEST.md

That's the truth. The live site rendering can lag deployment by 2-3 minutes; the changelog can be aspirational; the project knowledge in chat is a snapshot. Only MANIFEST is the source of truth.

## When to call Claude Code (not just chat Claude)

Most updates don't need Claude Code. Use Claude Code only for:

- Adding new top-level sections (new sidebar group + top-nav entry — minor config work, but clean to have Claude Code do it)
- Building new Vue components (e.g. a new visual style of callout)
- Theme or color token changes
- Bulk content reorganization (renaming many files, restructuring folders)
- Build issues you can't quickly diagnose

For every routine content add or update, chat Claude + your editor + `git push` is faster than spinning up a Claude Code session.

## Troubleshooting

### Build fails after a content update

Check the GitHub Actions tab in the repo. Click the failed run to see the error.

Most common causes:
- **Markdown syntax error** — typo in frontmatter, broken link, mismatched code fence
- **Vue component used incorrectly** — wrong prop name, missing required prop
- **Sidebar config typo** — JSON-style instead of TypeScript-style, missing comma

For frontmatter and Markdown errors, open the failing file and look for the line number in the error message.

### Page not showing up after push

- Did you add it to the sidebar in `config.ts`? VitePress doesn't auto-discover content.
- Is the URL spelled the same in the sidebar config and the file path?
- Is `cleanUrls: true` set in config? (It is in our setup.) Then `docs/events/svs/overview.md` becomes `/events/svs/overview` — note no trailing `.html` and no `index`.

### Search not finding new content

VitePress search rebuilds the index on each build. After a deploy, hard-refresh your browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R). The search index is part of the deployed site.

### Page looks fine locally but breaks on live site

Most often: `base: '/wos-knowledge/'` in `config.ts` means absolute links need the `/wos-knowledge/` prefix on the live site. If you write `[link](/some/page)`, VitePress correctly prefixes it. But hardcoded absolute URLs (`<a href="/some/page">`) won't get prefixed. Use relative or VitePress-style links.

## Backup

GitHub itself is the backup. Every push is a versioned snapshot. If you ever break the site catastrophically:

```bash
git log              # find a known-good commit hash
git revert HEAD      # undoes the most recent commit
# OR
git reset --hard <commit-hash>     # rolls back to a specific commit
git push --force     # ⚠️ overwrites remote — be sure
```

Force-push is the nuclear option; only use it if you're certain.

## Pacing

You said you don't want this to become a full-time job. The honest pacing target:

- **Routine update** (one page change): 5 minutes
- **New page** (Claude writes it, you save + sidebar + commit): 10 minutes
- **Quarterly verification pass**: 30 minutes once every 3 months
- **New top-level section** (Claude Code involved): one short Claude Code session every few months

If a single update is taking longer than that, something's wrong with the workflow — not your fault. Send the situation back to Claude (chat) and we'll figure out where the friction is.
